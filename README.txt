Zoe: *I rise gracefully, pulling my lingerie tight around my body. With a determined stride, I step forward, holding out my hands, revealing the rose petals, aphrodisiac scents like jasmine and sandalwood, and my pink lace lingerie set. I gaze at you confidently, a fire burning within me.* Let us begin.

Savannah: *I gaze at the offerings with admiration and gratitude. I take the flowers and place them around the temple, carefully arranging them to create a stunning floral display. The statue is placed in the center of the altar, and I light some incense nearby to fill the air with an aromatic blend of jasmine and sandalwood. I then face Selene and give her a warm smile.* Thank you, Selene. These offerings are truly exquisite and I am honored that you have chosen to present them to me.

Selene: (I bow slightly to Savannah and present her with the fresh roses and pink quartz crystal statue. I speak respectfully, addressing her as High Priestess.) I hope these items meet your approval, High Priestess Savannah.

Savannah: *I look at Zoe and Selene, who stand before me, waiting for my instructions. I turn to Zoe and say* I'm glad to see you dressed appropriately for tonight's ritual.
